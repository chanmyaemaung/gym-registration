# Gym Registration

This is a Full Stack CRUD Gym Registration App built using Angular 15 and Angular Material, Bootstrap 5 and Fontawesome icon v4.7.0. It was created by Chen Lay (info@chanmyaemaung.net), and allows users to register and calculate their BMI, as well as view user details and inquiries. The backend uses Json-server as a fake mock server.

## Features
- User registration and login
- BMI calculation based on user input
- View user details and inquiry history
- Edit and delete user information
- Responsive design with Angular Material components and Bootstrap styling
- Icons provided by Fontawesome icon v4.7.0

## Installation
To install the app, simply clone the repository and run `npm install` in your terminal to install the necessary dependencies.

## Development server
To start the development server, run `ng serve` in your terminal. This will launch the application at `http://localhost:4200/`, and any changes you make to the source files will automatically reload the application.

## Code scaffolding
To generate a new component, run `ng generate component component-name` in your terminal. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module` for other types of code scaffolding.

## Build
To build the project, run `ng build` in your terminal. The built artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests
To execute unit tests, run `ng test` in your terminal. This will run the tests via Karma.

## Running end-to-end tests
To execute end-to-end tests, run `ng e2e` in your terminal. Before running this command, you must first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
